1. **Time Spent on the Coding Test:**

   - I spent approximately 2-3 hours on the coding test, including the initial planning, development, testing, and documentation.

2. **Useful Language Feature and Code Snippet:**

   - One of the most useful recent features added to React is the `useEffect` hook, which allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It provides a cleaner and more flexible way to handle lifecycle-related logic compared to class-based components.

   - Here's an example of how I used the `useEffect` hook in the `TaskManager` component to load tasks from localStorage and save changes to localStorage:

     ```javascript
     // Load tasks from localStorage on component mount
     useEffect(() => {
       const savedTasks = localStorage.getItem("tasks");
       if (savedTasks) {
         setTasks(JSON.parse(savedTasks));
       }
     }, []);

     // Save tasks to localStorage whenever they change
     useEffect(() => {
       localStorage.setItem("tasks", JSON.stringify(tasks));
     }, [tasks]);
     ```

3. **Tracking Down Performance Issues in Production:**

   - To track down performance issues in a production environment, I would start by monitoring the application's key performance metrics, such as page load times, network requests, and client-side rendering performance.
   - Some tools I would use for this include:
     - **Browser Developer Tools**: Inspect the performance tab to identify bottlenecks, long-running tasks, and potential memory leaks.
     - **Performance Monitoring Tools**: Services like New Relic, Datadog, or Sentry can provide detailed insights into the application's performance and help identify problem areas.
     - **Profiling and Tracing**: Using tools like React Profiler, I can identify performance-heavy components and optimize them.
   - I have encountered performance issues in production before, and the key is to quickly isolate the problem, gather relevant data, and systematically investigate the root cause. This may involve code profiling, network analysis, or reviewing infrastructure configurations.

4. **Additional Features and Improvements:**

   - If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements to the task management application:

   - **Due Date Sorting and Filtering**: Allow users to sort tasks by due date and filter by upcoming, overdue, and past due tasks.
   - **Recurring Tasks**: Implement the ability to set tasks as recurring, with options for daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence.
   - **Subtasks and Checklists**: Enable users to create subtasks or checklists within a main task, allowing for more granular task management.
   - **Attachments and Notes**: Allow users to attach files or add notes to tasks, providing more context and details.
   - **Collaboration and Sharing**: Implement features for users to share tasks with others, assign tasks, and collaborate on task completion.
   - **Calendar View**: Add a calendar-based view to provide a better overview of upcoming tasks and due dates.
   - **Mobile Optimized UI**: Ensure the application is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, with a tailored user experience.
   - **User Accounts and Authentication**: Implement user accounts, authentication, and the ability to save and access tasks across devices.
   - **Notifications and Reminders**: Send email or in-app notifications to users about upcoming or overdue tasks.
   - **Analytics and Reporting**: Provide users with analytical insights, such as task completion rates, productivity trends, and team-level reports.

These additional features would enhance the overall functionality and usability of the task management application, making it a more comprehensive and powerful tool for users to manage their tasks effectively.
